Zarkin watched the pale glow out the window slowly fade. Stars began to appear around the edges, slowly working their way inward. As the Trandun Trawler transitioned from hyperspace to normal space he could hear the wind of the engines and warp field in flux all around him. A bright star appeared in the center of the window, slowly growing larger until it was the size of his thumb held at arms length. 
Then another bright spot appeared in the sky. It looked like a star at first, but then it, too, began to grow. It soon grew as large as the star, but then surpassed it. As it continued to grow the brightness faded and it's features became apparent. It was a gibbous shape, mostly blue, but flecked all over with white. Oceans. Clouds. On the dark edge some faint city lights could be seen. 
The shapes of continents on the surface resolved themselves in his mind as they grew larger and recognizable. He saw a familiar peninsula jutting out into a small ocean. Somewhere down there, a small place he longed to be.
Home at last. Hello, world.
